    Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.

    Navigate to the 'student-package' folder using the 'cd' command.

    Run the following command to compile the Java files:
''''
javac Token.java CompilationException.java LexicalAnalyser.java AbstractGenerate.java AbstractSyntaxAnalyser.java Generate.java SyntaxAnalyser.java Compile.java
''''
Press 'Enter' to execute the compilation command.

After successful compilation, run the following command to execute the compiler:

========================Understanding Compilation Exceptions:================================


    CompilationException - SyntaxError in Program 2:
        Issue: Typo in the keyword "begim" instead of "begin".
        Cause: Incorrect keyword spelling.

    CompilationException - SyntaxError in Program 7:
        Issue: The "else" keyword doesn't have a corresponding "if" statement.
        Cause: Unmatched "else" keyword without a preceding "if" statement.

    CompilationException - SyntaxError in Program 9:
        Issue: Missing semicolon after x3 := x3 + x2 in the loop.
        Cause: Syntax error due to the missing semicolon.

    CompilationException - SyntaxError in Program 10:
        Issue: Incorrect loop syntax; missing the else keyword.
        Cause: Loop syntax error, lacking the required else keyword.

    CompilationException - SyntaxError in Program 7:
        Issue: Missing semicolon after x2 := a - b + c - d + e.
        Cause: Syntax error due to the missing semicolon.

    CompilationException - SyntaxError in Program 7:
        Issue: Missing then keyword after else.
        Cause: Syntax error in the conditional statement, lacking the required then keyword.
 
 
 
==========================Compilation Exceptions:===============================



   Caused by Expected symbol: EOF, but found: 
        Issue: Unexpected symbol at the end of the program, possibly an extra character or syntax error.
        Cause: The program unexpectedly ends before reaching the expected end-of-file (EOF) symbol.

    Caused by Expected symbol: EOF, but found: else
        Issue: Unexpected "else" keyword at the end of the program without a corresponding "if" statement.
        Cause: The "else" keyword lacks a preceding "if" statement, causing a syntax error.

    Caused by Expected symbol: EOF, but found: IDENTIFIER
        Issue: Unexpected identifier at the end of the program, suggesting a possible variable or keyword error.
        Cause: The program expects the end-of-file (EOF) symbol but encounters an identifier instead.



Note: After implementing try-catch blocks, the specific symbols causing the issues have changed, but the general nature of the problems remains.
